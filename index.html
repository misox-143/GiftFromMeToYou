  <p class=" letter">  I know it's way way too late <br> but I want to start by wishing you a very happy birthday!<br> You are the first real bestfriend I ever had <br> and more of an older sister to me than a friend! <br> You are the only person I talk to on a daily bases,<br> you are the first person that comes to my mind when I feel that something is upsetting me!<br> You are the only person I can tell anything no matter how silly it is without feeling judged!<br> Whenever I come early to school I get excited to see you and just talk to you about random things <br> maybe vent to you or maybe you vent to me<br> I genuinely enjoy your company and you are my comfort person!<br> When I see distance means nothing when the people mean everything you immediately come to my mind!<br> Because I know that even if you moved out our relationship wouldn't be affected at all!<br> And that's something I don't have with all people!<br> I love you to the moon and to Saturn!<br> yours, <br> Rasha!ðŸ©·ðŸŽ€ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹</p>
